<h1>Peter Dagler's Webpage</h1>
<p>Hello people of the internet, this is my webpage, or websight. Right now it is in
  pre alpha I guess... since you can't do anything but read, but it will get better.
  Pretty soon I might even add games that I made, and even sooner I will add links
  to other websights I made.</p>
  <p1>So I hope you guyes will enjoy it</p1>
